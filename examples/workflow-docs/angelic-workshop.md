# Angelic Workshop Process

## Overview

The Angelic Workshop is a structured multi-step healing and empowerment session designed to help participants connect with their higher guidance, clear energetic blockages, and receive personalized angelic transmissions. Each workshop flows through five phases, each handled by a specialist facilitator role.
