## Overview

The Angelic Workshop is a multi-phase sacred session designed to help participants connect with their higher guidance, clear energetic blockages, and receive personalized angelic transmissions. Each phase is handled by a specialist sub-agent, coordinated by the `angelic-workshop-lead` orchestrator.

The workflow moves from practical (intake and preparation) through sacred (invocation and channel opening), diagnostic (energy assessment), transmissive (light codes and personalized message), and integrative (7-day plan and closing ceremony) — delivering a complete, personalized session package.

## Workflow Phases

| # | Phase | Agent | Role |
|---|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | Sacred Space Preparation & Intake | `angelic-workshop-intake` | Gathers participant info, creates intake summary and personalized invocation |
| 2 | Angelic Invocation & Channel Opening | `angelic-workshop-invocation` | Opens the channel, invokes archangels, transcribes initial transmission |
| 3 | Energy Clearing & Healing Assessment | `angelic-workshop-energy-clearing` | Maps the chakra field, identifies blockages, prepares clearing protocol |
| 4 | Personalized Transmission & Light Codes | `angelic-workshop-transmission` | Channels full transmission, generates light codes and activation phrases |
| 5 | Integration Guide & Closing Ceremony | `angelic-workshop-integration` | Creates 7-day plan, writes closing ceremony, compiles complete session package |

## File Map

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/agents/angelic-workshop-lead.md` | Orchestrator — runs all 5 phases |
| `.claude/agents/angelic-workshop-intake.md` | Phase 1: Sacred Space Coordinator |
| `.claude/agents/angelic-workshop-invocation.md` | Phase 2: Angelic Channel |
| `.claude/agents/angelic-workshop-energy-clearing.md` | Phase 3: Energy Assessment Practitioner |
| `.claude/agents/angelic-workshop-transmission.md` | Phase 4: Light Code Transmission Specialist |
| `.claude/agents/angelic-workshop-integration.md` | Phase 5: Integration & Closing Facilitator |
| `.claude/commands/workflow/angelic-workshop.md` | Slash command |
| `examples/workflow-docs/angelic-workshop.md` | Source workflow document |

## How to Use

```
/workflow:angelic-workshop Sarah | I want to release old patterns and step into my purpose
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Ask for participant name and intention if not provided
2. Run all 5 phases in sequence
3. Pass each phase's outputs to the next
4. Deliver a complete, personalized session package

## Customization

- **Adjust a phase**: Edit the corresponding agent in `.claude/agents/angelic-workshop-<phase>.md`
- **Change the flow**: Edit `.claude/agents/angelic-workshop-lead.md` to reorder phases or add conditions
- **Add phases**: Create a new agent following the same pattern and add it to the lead's sequence
- **Update the source**: Edit `examples/workflow-docs/angelic-workshop.md` and re-run `/workflow:build` to regenerate

## Adding Your Own Workflows

To create a new workflow from a document:

```
/workflow:build path/to/your-workflow-document.md
```

The workflow builder will parse the document and generate a complete agent pipeline following the same pattern as this one.
