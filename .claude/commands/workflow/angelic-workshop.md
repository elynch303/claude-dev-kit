# /workflow:angelic-workshop — Angelic Workshop

Run a complete, personalized Angelic Workshop session for a participant. Five specialist sub-agents move through sacred space preparation, angelic invocation, energy clearing, full transmission with light codes, and 7-day integration — delivering a complete session package.

## Usage

```
/workflow:angelic-workshop Sarah | I want to release old patterns holding me back from my purpose
```

Or start without arguments and you'll be prompted for the details.

## What Happens

| Phase | Agent | What Occurs |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `angelic-workshop-intake` | Participant intake, personalized invocation prepared |
| 2 | `angelic-workshop-invocation` | Channel opens, angels step forward, initial transmission received |
| 3 | `angelic-workshop-energy-clearing` | Energetic assessment, chakra map, clearing protocol prepared |
| 4 | `angelic-workshop-transmission` | Full personalized transmission, light codes, activation phrases |
| 5 | `angelic-workshop-integration` | 7-day integration plan, closing ceremony, complete session package |

**Final output**: A complete, personalized Angelic Workshop session document — ready to deliver to the participant.

## Steps

### 1. Gather Session Information

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` — look for a name and intention separated by `|`, `-`, or a newline.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or incomplete, ask the user:

> To begin the Angelic Workshop, I need two things:
> 1. **Participant name** — What is the participant's name (or preferred name)?
> 2. **Session intention** — What are they seeking in this session? (What would they like to heal, understand, or call in?)
>
> Optional:
> 3. **Prior session notes** — Has this participant had a previous Angelic Workshop session? If so, share any relevant notes.
> 4. **Sensitivities** — Any physical, emotional, or spiritual sensitivities to honor in this session?

### 2. Spawn the Angelic Workshop Orchestrator

Use the Task tool:

```
description: "Run complete Angelic Workshop session"
agent: angelic-workshop-lead
prompt: |
  ## Angelic Workshop Session

  ### Participant Information
  - Name: [participant name]
  - Stated Intention: [their intention]
  - Prior Session Notes: [notes if provided, otherwise "None — first session"]
  - Sensitivities: [sensitivities if provided, otherwise "None noted"]

  ### Instructions
  Run the complete Angelic Workshop workflow.
  Spawn all 5 sub-agents in the correct sequence.
  Pass outputs between phases.
  Return the complete session package when all phases are complete.
```

### 3. Present the Session Package

Output the complete session package from `angelic-workshop-lead` directly to the user.

Optionally ask if they would like the package saved to a file:
> "Would you like me to save this session to a file for easy sharing with the participant?"

If yes:
```bash
FILENAME="angelic-workshop-$(echo '[name]' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-')-$(date +%Y%m%d).md"
# Write the session content to the file
echo "Session saved to: $FILENAME"
```

## Domain

This workflow operates in the spiritual healing and angelic guidance domain. All language, practices, and transmission content honors the sacred nature of this work. The agents are calibrated for loving, non-judgmental, empowering facilitation.
